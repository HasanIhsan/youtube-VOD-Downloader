# youtube vod downloader
* downloads the 720p image quality
> things to note: if the vod does not have 720p... well its not ment to handle anything other then that 
> (might update it later so if 720p does not exist then get 480p and so on)

# how to use:
[1]: put all your links into the links.txt
>		if you lost that file recreate it (has to be called links.txt)

[2]: run by using command: python downloadYoutubeVod.py 
* >

[3]: and let the magic happen!


## NOTE:
? this was created cause my internet is bad, so just incase i wanna watch video i can download them! (so when my internet is gone, i have something i can do)
> meaning: this is very not user friendly will prob update this later, with a gui (and turn it into 1 simple exe rather then what it is currently)
>          then again it all depends on when i get around to it!
