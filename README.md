# youtube vod downloader
* downloads the 720p image quality

# how to use:
* put all your links into the links.txt
* 		if you lost that file recreate it (has to be called links.txt)

* run by using command: python downloadYoutubeVod.py 
* and let the magic happen!


## NOTE:
* this was created cause my internet is bad, so just incase i wanna watch video i can download them! (so when my internet is gone, i have something i can do)
> meaning: this is very not user friendly will prob update this later, with a gui (and turn it into 1 simple exe rather then what it is currently)
>          then again it all depends on when i get around to it!
